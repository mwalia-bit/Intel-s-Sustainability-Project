# Intel-s-Sustainability-Project
WD Project 2

This project is an interactive timeline webpage highlighting Intel’s sustainability journey from 1968 to 2024. Built with HTML5, CSS3, and Font Awesome, the site uses responsive design, Flexbox, and scroll snap to ensure smooth navigation on both desktop and mobile. Each milestone card includes custom images and a flip animation that reveals more details on hover, making the experience engaging and informative. The hero section introduces Intel’s mission, while the footer provides navigation and social media links. This project demonstrates how design and interactivity can showcase innovation and responsibility in technology’s path toward a sustainable future.
